      <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
      <p class="justify">I am an   <span class="student">Intro to Programming</span>   student at Epicodus. Although I've dabbled with a limited amount of coding in the past several months, I'm mostly brand new to the world of computer coding, and excited to be learning this new set of skills. Previously, I've studied Anthropology at the University of Toronto and Music and Audio Engineering at Portland Community College.  I've lived many places in my life, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>New Jersey</li>
            <li>Toronto</li>
            <li>Florida</li>
            <li>Virginia</li>
            <li>Turkmenistan</li>
            <li>Washington, DC</li>
          </ul>
        <p>I've been living in Portland since 2012.</p>
        <p>I was in Peace Corps Turkmenistan from 2007-2010, teaching English in a small desert town called Kara-Kala. Since returning, I've worked as a teacher, in the hospitality industry, and most recently in the property management industry. The latter has given me valuable insight into project management, running a budget, and interacting with a Board of Directors, however it is ultimately an unsatisfying career field, and I am looking to transition.</p>
        <p>I'd love to apply new skills learned in the field of programming and web development towards my interests in music and art.</p>
